# Regression Trees in Python

A regression tree is a decision tree used for predicting continuous values (e.g., price, temperature).

- Splits data into regions based on features.

- Each leaf node contains the average value of training samples in that region.

Key library: `scikit-learn` (`DecisionTreeRegressor`).

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Build model
reg = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=3)
reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

```
